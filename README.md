# Ger's Garage 
### Final Project for CCT College - Dublin, Ireland <br /> 
- Main GOAL - To create a Mobile app to book services and online shopping for a garage.
  - The final project was divided into 2 projects, mobile application and API, to which the API would be an independent server and would always be running in the cloud waiting for requests.
  - The repository for the API server is found [here](https://github.com/LeandroFrazao/GarageFinalProjec).


## Mobile App
The mobile Application was made using the react native architecture, with Expo being the main framework. It was also necessary to install packages such as:
-	DropDownPicker from "react-native-dropdown-picker"- It is a drop-down list component;
-	Calendar from "react-native-calendars" – It is a calendar component;
-	Icon from "react-native-vector-icons/Ionicons"- It is a package with icons;
-	Moment from "moment" – It is a JavaScript date library;
